Version 0.0.8
=============

Minor changes to Unscented filter, mainly naming of local variables.


Version 0.0.7
=============

Significant changes to Unscented filter. Now separate classes for the different
sigma computations, and predict/update split out. Provision for supplying your own
residual and unscented transform functions.

Version 0.0.6
=============

The big change is 
Version 0.0.5
=============

* Fixed and included the fixed lag smoother algorithm.
* name change - all Z and Zs to z and zs. They are vectors, not matrices.
* Optional H parameter in KalmanFilter.update() to override the H matrix. Useful if you have a variable number of measurements on each update.


Version 0.0.4
=============
* Tests and fixes for the ExtendedKalmanFilter
* Minor name changes for the methods that compute Q in common


Version 0.0.3
=============

* Reverted the name change of .x to .X in the various classes. I have no idea what I was thinking - x is a vector, so it should be lower case.

* Moved some code to a new /examples directory to reduce clutter. It is worth noting that the code in there does not run now - it is based on the old procedural unscented KF code, not the new OO based code. However, the test_UKF.py code basically implements this example as a test using the new code. This is more a change for the future.
